# [Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/description)

# Intuition

The problem requires maximizing the score of a binary matrix by toggling rows and columns. To achieve the maximum score, we can follow a two-step approach:

1. Ensure that each row starts with a 1 by toggling rows if necessary.
2. Maximize each column by toggling if necessary, while considering the score contribution of each column.

# Approach

1. Toggle Rows: Iterate through each row of the grid. If the first cell of a row is 0, toggle the entire row to make it start with a 1.
2. Maximize Columns: Iterate through each column of the grid. Count the number of 1s in the current column. Choose the maximum count between 1s and 0s, and calculate the score contribution of the column. Add this contribution to the total score.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n√óm), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid.

- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using constant extra space.

# Code

```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
const matrixScore = function(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length; // number of rows in the grid
    const cols = grid[0].length; // number of columns in the grid

    // Step 1: Toggle rows to ensure the first column has all 1s
    for (let row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
        if (grid[row][0] === 0) {
            // If the first cell is 0, toggle the entire row
            for (let col = 0; col < cols; ++col) {
                grid[row][col] ^= 1; // XOR with 1 will toggle the bit
            }
        }
    }

    let score = 0; // Initialize the total score

    // Step 2: Maximize each column by toggling if necessary
    for (let col = 0; col < cols; ++col) {
        let countOnes = 0; // Count of ones in the current column
        for (let row = 0; row < rows; ++row) {
            // Count how many 1s are there in the current column
            countOnes += grid[row][col];
        }
        // Choose the max between countOnes and the number of 0s (which is rows - countOnes)
        score += Math.max(countOnes, rows - countOnes) * (1 << (cols - col - 1));
    }

    return score; // Return the total score
};
```
